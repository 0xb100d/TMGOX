We are in the process of setting up forum for early grin exchange before it is integrated into more user-friendly centralized exchanges.
We are aiming to help sync buyers with sellers OTC.

Multiple ways to get started:
The homepage: https://tmgox.com/exchange

Since we don't know the hashrate or exchange rate or anything, right now this page consists of just a form to submit your interest,
some general information about your interest, and your ballpark bids/asks. This is the bare minimum amount of information we can use
to start developing a market for grin, and eventually will be a way for TMGOX to link parties to trade.


The gitter: https://gitter.im/grinexchange/community
The subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/grintrader/
The telegram: https://t.me/grintrader

By using atomic swaps like the http://713.mw wallet, the duty of TMGOX should just be to link parties to each other so they can trade P2P
without fees, and our job will just be to create as much transparency and information as possible.

What does TMGOX gain? Well we get first look at offers of course, and can buy as much grin as we want, but the primary aim is to expedite price discovery
and trade in hopes of minimizing arbitrage and unruly price inflation early on. The sooner we get a consensus on value of a grin the sooner
grin can start being used a means of exchange.
