Happy solstice, wizards.
Here is our second and last Transparency Report of the year. 

There should have been more, and it is not that we are trying to steal funds for ourselves, it just takes a long time to 2FA our way into everything and actually do the tallying and sending. That is not the best excuse given the circumstances and point of the whole endeavor, so in 2020 we are shooting for quarterly reports.

THE FUN NUMBERS:
We sold $10,679 worth of grin merch (if you don't count discounts or expenses).
That's 96 orders with an average of 3 items per order.
Mostly stickers, pins and books.
Of course a bunch of shirts and hoodies too.

That's pretty sweet.

Unfortunately most of that was paid for in crypto, for which we give steep discounts [33% off for grin payments, 20-25% off for BTC/ETH/Monero).

A more accurate (but unfortunately an estimate) would be 80% of that first number or:

$8,543.

Alas...

We also spent:

$2,794 
on materials for hard goods (not including stickers and Grinoires)

as well as:

$4,291
to print our awesome cypherpunk encyclopedia of ~2,000 pages.

which leaves

$1,452
total profit.

Turns out it costs ~$100 to ship a heavy book across the planet, but we figure that expense is cancelled out by the unsold copies (8) of the grinoire we will make money off of, and the adrenaline rush of sending anarchist reading material around the world (priceless) so we are not including that. Kind of sketchy how loose we are running these numbers, we aim to keep better track in 2020. Accounting is not our forte.

We have our ongoing expenses for firewalls and site hosting but to the dungeon with them.

We just sent ~$2,000 USD to grin dev fund. 0.28066762 BTC to be exact.

Thanks to everyone for their support and patience. We will be sending out a new edition of the newsletter with sneak peaks of new products and a link to this report in the new year.

Happy solstice, wizards.
