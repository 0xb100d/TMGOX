Our expenses are in fiat, but the majority of purchases were in crypto, so with falling crypto prices 
and unwillingness to swap to state backed ASAP, and our further unwillingness to calculate exactly how much that appears 
to have cut in to our profits, we decided to just round up and send .12777 BTC to the grin security campaign.

While the falling fiat value of bitcoin has taken some of the fun out of things, and the Grin Prefects are calling Nov30
