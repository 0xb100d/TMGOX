So yes we are not very consistent with these reports. But we aren't ripping anybody off, and TMGOX is almost fully autonomous, so the timing of these reports is not all that important (until we exit-scam that is, in which case, it also wouldn't matter).
Still transparency in general is good and interesting for all involved, so these reports are not going to disappear any time soon. We just really want to get the GRINOIRE published and then we can go back to boring transparency reports.

We now accept GRIN in the store, that's the biggest thing, and are looking forward to our first transfer of GRIN from our vault to the grin developers, it seems historic in our small history.

Sales have slown down somewhat, probably beacuse all the big grin fans already got all their gear, we encourage you to tell your friends about TMGOX, and send us your designs and ideas to help keep everything fresh.

Breakdown of expenses and revenue coming soon! Hopefull end of the month when we ship the GRINOIRE... which if you don't have one yet, you are missing out.
